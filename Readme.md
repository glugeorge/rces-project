# Research Computing in Earth Science Final Project Proposal
By George Lu

## Research Question:
How does variable meltwater runoff influence glacier velocities on the Greenland Ice Sheet?

## Description
I will be using two data sets, one being the output from a climate model for monthly run-off on the Greenland Ice Sheet (model: MAR, data at:) and the other being ice sheet velocity data.
